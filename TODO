* Definitions
** A STORY is a self-contained chunk of usable functionality where the end-user can engage the application in a round-trip fashion.
** A TASK is a technical task that is necessary of setup, configuration or deployment of the application, but does not by itself produce any new feature that an end-user can interact with.
** A CHORE is a non-technical task that is necessary for communication to, coordination or organization of participants or users of the project.
